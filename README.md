## 🔑 Key Points and Steps I took to optimize the performance

- Reduced the bundle size drastically by using code-splitting and lazy loading to improve the User Experience.
- Used Redux to manage the state of the application.
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders by keeping components state local.
- Maintained structured readable code using MVC Pattern.
- Used Axios to make the API calls from the frontend.
- Built multiple dynamic and browser compatible pages.
- Built a complex form using the react-hook-form npm package.
- Worked with JSON web tokens for authentication and authorization security configurations using Node.js.
- Wrote all the CRUD operations.
